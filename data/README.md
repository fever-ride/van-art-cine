This folder is intentionally empty in the public repository. In real ingestion runs, the scraper and processing scripts generate raw screening data and cached API responses, which are stored here locally and not committed due to size and variability.

In the actual project structure, this directory also contains a subfolder named latest/ that holds the raw scraped screening data, but it is omitted from the public repo.
